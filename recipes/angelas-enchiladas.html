    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These chicken enchiladas are easy to make with tortillas and a creamy chicken filling flavored with the perfect amount of seasonings, green chiles, and cheese. The secret is in the seasonings! Delicious with sour cream and a side of Mexican rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast meat - cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups sour cream</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained</li>
        <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package mild taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lime juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>5 (12-inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) can enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Shred chicken with two forks.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong><br>At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, water, 1/2 of the green onions, green chiles, and taco seasoning; simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder; simmer for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong><br>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong><br>Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the chicken. Spread remaining soup mixture over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong><br>Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the chicken mixture and about 5 tablespoons Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong><br>Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking dish. Pour enchilada sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar, remaining green onions, and olives.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 9</strong><br>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
